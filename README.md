# automatic-MD-labelling

Here is a script that will automatically file this Mini Disc Labels template: https://wikifiles.z5.web.core.windows.net/labels/MinidiscLabels.svg

To use it it is only necessary:

1. Name the cover jpg or png files the following way : "Title - Artist - Year" or  "Title - Artist" or  "Title - Artist".
2. Put all the cover files you want to convert as MD label in the same folder as create-labels.py.
3. Optionaly modify line line 28 of 'create-md-labels.py' to choose an alternative color theme.
4. In terminal run the command 'python3 create-md-labels.py'.
